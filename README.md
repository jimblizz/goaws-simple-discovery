# GoDisco
A simple Golang wrapper to get Amazon EC2s instance IPs by tag.

This is useful for service discovery on small, simple deployments.

You probably shouldn't use this unless your needs are specific to Go, AWS and very little complexity!
Check out etcd or Consul for a proper service discovery solution.
